# bird_detection_nn

This project is bird detection system which uses multi-channel deep convolutional neural networks.
You can find a full report about it, [here](report.pdf)

If you are interested in running this project you may find useful those [pre-trained models](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ULIBYWeFJwmqh7a5SVlofHit9XIfWGi1/view), 
you may also use the original DCASE 2018 workshop [datasets](http://dcase.community/challenge2018/task-bird-audio-detection) to train your own models.
